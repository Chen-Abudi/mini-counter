## üîé Intro:

This is a practice project in React which displays a mini counter. The main focus on behind the scenes of react along optimization techniques.

## üß∞ Tech Stack:

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- Vite

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques:

- **_React APIs_**:
  - **`Memo`**: React memo checks for changes between the previous and current values for a given prop passed to the component. The default function carries out a shallow comparison on each passed in prop. It then checks for equality of incoming values with the existing values.
    - **`Note`**: **Don't overuse memo()!**
      - **Use it `as high up in the component tree as possible`**:
        Blocking a component execution there will also block all child component executions.
      - **Checking props with memo() `costs performance!`**: Don't wrap it around all your components - it will add a lot of unnecessary checks.
      - **`Do Not` use it on components where `props will change frequently`**: **_memo()_** would just perform a meaningless check in such cases (which costs performance).
- **_React Hooks_**:
  - **`useCallback()`**: This hook lets you memoize a callback function by preventing it from being created again on every render, which means that the callback function is cached and doesn't get redefined on every render.
  - **`useMemo()`**: It designed to optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations. With using **useMemo()**, React will store the result of a function call and reuse it when the dependencies of that function haven't changed, rather than recalculating the value on every render.
    - **`Note`**: **Don't overuse useMemo()!** Do not use useMemo() until you notice that some parts of your application are running frustratingly slow.
